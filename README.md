# Lithium-ion Capacity Calculator

This is a simple command-line program for calculating the theoretical capacities of novel conversion-type electrode materials. The capacities are largely sourced from [Nitta et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mattod.2014.10.040).

## Using this Calculator

- Simply run the program and enter the formula of a chemical compound (e.g. `Al2O3`, `Fe2(SO4)3`).
- Non-stoichiometric compounds (e.g. `Fe0.9S`) are not handled. 
- Hydrates (e.g. `CoCl2·6H2O`) are not handled correctly. Instead, rewrite in the format `CoCl2(H2O)6`.
