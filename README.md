# Lithium-ion Capacity Calculator

This is a simple command-line program for calculating the theoretical capacities of novel conversion-type electrode materials. The capacities are largely sourced from [Nitta et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mattod.2014.10.040).

## Using this Calculator

- Simply run the program and enter the formula of a chemical compound (e.g. Al2O3, Fe2(SO4)3).
- The program can handle parentheses "()" but not square brackets "[]".
- Non-stoichiometric compounds (e.g. Fe0.9S) are not handled.
